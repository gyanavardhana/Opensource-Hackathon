 Wanna Listen to music while doing work but you are too busy to open youtube and play whatever you like it's now simple you just need to go to another tab and click play
 You add the link of your playlists with the name you like and the extensions saves it for you and after clicking the play icon you'll be navigated to your playlist location and the autoplay is enabled for you after you play it. Now feel free and cool while working with the joy of music. You can delete it if you don't love it anymore.

 ## Note:
 - The link should be in this format: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfHLjXZGynZ7wyO3EZjwS0ouZJaathCtR it should have a list tag.
 - You should not add the same link twice if you delete one all duplicates are deleted
 - Vibing is important and the website blocking doesn't imply until you know the trick

# Additional feature:
- ### Website Blocking:
      The things that make us distract are need to stopped for a while so we enabled website blocking whenever we use this extension in dev mode to enable dev mode:
       - Right click on the extension and enable inspect
       - Minimize inspect window and do some work
       - If you open any distracting website on same tab you will be blocked and a default message appears
